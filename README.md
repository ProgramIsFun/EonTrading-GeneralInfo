for put warrant

| Asset Price Movement                   | Impact on Put Warrant Holder      |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Price falls below strike price         | Profit ("in the money")           |
| Price above strike price at expiry     | Warrant expires worthless (loss)  |
| Price rises before expiry              | Value drops, potential to lose part/all of premium paid |


Buying a put warrant is like betting the asset price will fall. If it rises instead, you lose (at worst, all the premium paid for the warrant).
